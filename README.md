Priscilla adding some stuff - 1st change

Well, can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside
But baby, you hardly even notice
When I try to show you
This song is meant to keep ya
From doing what you're supposed to
Like waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now
