Priscilla adding some stuff - 1st change

Well, can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside
But baby, you hardly even notice
When I try to show you
This song is meant to keep ya

This is priscilla making a change to the middle of the current text - 2nd change

From doing what you're supposed to
Like waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now
