Priscilla adding some stuff - 1st change - I am changing this line (3rd change)

Well, can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside
But baby, you hardly even notice
When I try to show you
This song is meant to keep ya

This is priscilla making a change to the middle of the current text - 2nd change

From doing what you're supposed to
Like waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now




It was an April morning when they told us we should go
As I turn to you, you smiled at me
How could we say no?
Oh, the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Oh, the songs to sing
When we at last return again
Slipping off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil's in his hole
Oh, to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh, to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah
Into the sun, the south, the north
At last the birds have flown
The shackles of commitment fell
In pieces on the ground
